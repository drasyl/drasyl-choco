	<description>
**Note: This package comes without any Java dependency. You have to install a JRE or JDK by yourself.** 

drasyl is a general-purpose overlay network framework for rapid development of distributed P2P
applications.

By using drasyl developers can fully concentrate on creating distributed applications. With drasyl,
boundaries between IP-based networks will be eliminated and secure communication channels between
any peers will be provided. Zero-configuration is required to use drasyl. Developers can run a new
drasyl node without having to write configuration files or provide IP addresses of peers.
